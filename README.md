# KV-eval-dataset

This repository provides the two publicly available datasets as well as our dataset for evaluating the fact checking capability in a knowledge graph.

## Publicly available datasets

**The Synthetic dataset (synt.tsv)** contains a set of [English DBpedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/develop/datasets/downloads-2016-10)-style triples that comprises true triples manually extracted from Wikipedia tables, and false triples automatically generated by negative sampling.

**The Real-World dataset (real.tsv)** derived from [Google Relation Extraction Corpora](https://ai.googleblog.com/2013/04/50000-lessons-on-how-to-read-relation.html/) and [WSDM Cup Triple Scoring Challenge](https://www.wsdm-cup-2017.org/triple-scoring.html/), which contains a set of English DBpedia-style triples that comprises true triples manually extracted from Wikipedia texts by crowdsourcing, and false triples automatically generated by negative sampling.

## Issues in the publicly available datasets

**1. False triples in these datasets are automatically generated by negative sampling.**

Therefore, these datasets contain false-labeled true triples (false negatives) that is probable to make an evaluation inaccurate. 

According to our analysis, at least 4% of false triples in these datasets are false negatives.

**2. Some true triples in these datasets are already contained in the existing knowledge graph, English DBpedia.**

This means that some test cases in these datasets can be easily solved by checking whether a given triple is contained in a knowledge graph or not.

According to our analysis, 77.26% of the Synthetic dataset and 8.58% of the Real-World dataset are already contained in the knowledge graph, English DBpedia.

## Our dataset

**Our dataset (ours.tsv)** is constructed by manually labeling true or false labels on the [K-Box](http://kbox.kaist.ac.kr)-style triples extracted from Wikipedia texts by the state-of-the-art [BERT-based relation extractor](https://github.com/machinereading/bert-ko-re/).

```

Our dataset is constructed to solve the afore-mentioned issues in the two ways:
* **False triples are manually checked to prevent false negatives.** Specifically, we labeled a given triple as false if there is no Wikipedia article that contains a sentence supporting that the given triple is true.
* **True triples are included in our dataset only if the given triple is not contained in the knowledge graph, K-Box.**

These makes our dataset more reasonable and challenging to evaluate the fact checking capability on newly found triples missing in a knowledge graph than the publicly available datasets.
